<p>I’m thinking I’ll take one out of <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin’s</a> blog, and keep my posts shorter. Hopefully that will result in more of them!</p>
<p>I’m currently involved in a co-founder role with <a href="http://ventureboard.co/">VentureBoard</a>. We’ve recently hired an additional developer to the project. He is great with Ruby on Rails, has an eye for detail, and experience working with start-ups. It thus came as no surprise that he had lots of offers and opportunities on his table. Why did he choose VentureBoard? The following reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>We strive for an environment where developers make important business decisions and the best idea wins</li>
<li>We’re solving a real problem in a market that is ripe for disruption</li>
<li>We use whatever the best technology is to solve a given problem</li>
<li>We build, ship, and iterate as quickly as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to say that no other companies do this, but as a developer myself, I can confidentially say these are a lot of what great developers are looking for. Skip the ping-pong tables, espresso machines, and five hundred dollar chairs. Great culture comes from smart employees solving problems.</p>
